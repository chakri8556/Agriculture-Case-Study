The pomato (a portmanteau of potato and tomato) is a grafted plant. 
That is produced by grafting together a tomato plant and a potato plant. 
Both of which are members of the Solanum genus in the Solanaceae (nightshade) family. 
Cherry tomatoes grow on the vine, while white potatoes grow in the soil from the same plant.
